Customizing the Navbar:

The logo is located in the .logo section. Update the logo image or text as needed.
Search Icon:

The search icon can be customized by changing the icon class in the HTML. You can either use an icon font (like Font Awesome) or a custom image.
If you want to use a custom image for the search icon, update the background property of .search-icon i in the CSS.
Responsive Design:

The layout is responsive for screens less than 768px wide. You can tweak the CSS for mobile devices by modifying the media query section.
Featured Section:

To update the featured section content, edit the HTML inside the .featured container. This section includes a title, description, and video thumbnail.
Footer Section:

The footer contains links, social media icons, and a subscription form. Update the social media icon images and links as needed.
Newsletter Section:

Users can subscribe to the newsletter by filling out the form. You can customize the text and button style as per your needs.
Styling
The project uses custom CSS for all the styling. The .featured, .video-grid, .recommended, and other classes have specific styles for each section.
The hover effects and transitions have been defined to provide a smooth user experience.
The .navbar, .footer, .search-icon, and other sections have customizable properties like background color, text size, font, etc.
Customization
To change the theme, you can edit the color scheme in the CSS. The primary colors used are red (#f04b4b), black (#121212), and white.
The layout is flexible for expansion, and additional sections can be added easily by following the existing structure.
